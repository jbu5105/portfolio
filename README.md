## Work Experience
**Project Leader - Research Scientist - Vision @ ARQUIMEA Research Center (_October 2023 - Present_)**

â€¢Lead a cross-functional team of four in applied research on 3D scene editing, ensuring results translated into production-ready code for client-facing products.

â€¢ Contributed to core research on diffusion 3D editing and novel-view synthesis, focusing on efficiency and real-time applicability.

â€¢ Successfully integrated proprietary research outcomes into the customerâ€™s codebase, bridging the gap between experimental ML and robust software deployment.

**Research Scientist - Speech @ Daisys.ai (_February 2021 - October 2023_)**

â€¢ Developed and deployed deep learning Text-to-Speech models in production systems used by multiple clients.

â€¢ Maintained internal ML platforms and tools, including model versioning, continuous integration, and performance monitoring.

â€¢ Led DSP-based preprocessing pipelines for speech data tailored to real-world, client-provided datasets.

â€¢ Supervise master thesis from the Master of Artificial Intelligence at Leiden University and lead interns.

## Projects
### ðŸ’» 3D Scene Editing via 2D Diffusion Models
[Scene Editing Video](https://youtu.be/FE95ppQPnW4)

Developed a propietary method to edit pretrained 3DGS scenes using 2D Diffusion models. I used **Python** and **Pytorch** to implement a reprojection algorithm that based on a first edit given a prompt, reprojected that edit into the other poses biasing a diffusion model so that the synthesized new poses were consistent to the first edit. See an example below:
