## Work Experience
**Project Leader - Research Scientist - Vision @ ARQUIMEA Research Center (_October 2023 - Present_)**

•Lead a cross-functional team of four in applied research on 3D scene editing, ensuring results translated into production-ready code for client-facing products.

• Contributed to core research on diffusion 3D editing and novel-view synthesis, focusing on efficiency and real-time applicability.

• Successfully integrated proprietary research outcomes into the customer’s codebase, bridging the gap between experimental ML and robust software deployment.

**Research Scientist - Speech @ Daisys.ai (_February 2021 - October 2023_)**

• Developed and deployed deep learning Text-to-Speech models in production systems used by multiple clients.

• Maintained internal ML platforms and tools, including model versioning, continuous integration, and performance monitoring.

• Led DSP-based preprocessing pipelines for speech data tailored to real-world, client-provided datasets.

• Supervise master thesis from the Master of Artificial Intelligence at Leiden University and lead interns.

## Projects
### 💻 Fast 3D Scene Editing via One Step Diffusion Models (Coming soon...)

### 💻 3D Scene Editing via 2D Diffusion Models (2024)
[Scene Editing Video](https://youtu.be/FE95ppQPnW4)

Developed a propietary method to edit pretrained 3DGS scenes using 2D Diffusion models. I used **Python** and **Pytorch** to implement a reprojection algorithm that based on a first edit given a prompt, reprojected that edit into the other poses biasing a diffusion model so that the synthesized new poses were consistent to the first edit. See an example below:

### 🧑‍🏫 Supervised Master Thesis on "Quantization of NeRF algorithm inference for FPGA implementation with integers" (2024)
[Link to thesis](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7247893709281779712/)

In this master thesis we explored the different types of quantization algorithms existing for Deep Learning models. Then we quantized a NeRF model via Post-Traning Quantization and run evaluations to compare against original model. To conclude the work, we make an analysis of the necessary FPGA components to run NeRF quantized models and propose several FPGA models. 

### 💻 Text-To-Speech Research and Deployment (2021-2023)
